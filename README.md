# SWEN Intro

My name is Xander Palmer. I went to Irondequoit High School which is in Rochester, closer to the lake.
My hobbies include programming, playing the piano, cooking, and learning new things.
My favorite food is currently a tie between burritos and burgers, as they both are filled with flavor

I hope to learn the following in my software engineering class:
- How to work better with others
- Important resources and websites to help me succeed
- The true definition and meaning of a software engineer
